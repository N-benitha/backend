# Change Request Tracking System
  ![alt banner](crts.png)

Like any software team, we’ve all felt the frustration of chasing down change requests, lost email threads, and unclear deployment histories. I experienced it firsthand while working on various projects, where keeping track of who requested what, when it was deployed, and what issues followed could become chaotic quickly. That challenge led me to build the Change Request Tracking System (CRTS), a comprehensive, full-stack web application designed to centralize and streamline the management of software change requests across development projects. In environments where accountability and traceability are crucial for quality delivery, CRTS has your back. It keeps projects organized, teams informed, and change management transparent, because when systems work smoothly, so do people.

## Overview
A comprehensive full-stack web application for managing software change requests across development projects. Built with modern technologies and featuring role-based access control for efficient project management.

> **Note**: This project consists of two separate repositories:
> - **Frontend**: [ChangeRequest_TrackingSystem](https://github.com/N-benitha/ChangeRequest_TrackingSystem.git)
> - **Backend**: [backend](https://github.com/N-benitha/backend.git)

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Project Management** - Create, update, and manage software projects
- **Change Request Tracking** - Submit, review, and track change requests with status updates
- **User Management** - Admin controls for user creation and role assignment
- **Role-Based Access Control** - Three distinct user roles with specific permissions
- **Real-time Reports** - Analytics and reporting dashboard with filtering options
- **Project Assignment** - Assign users to specific projects with proper authorization

### User Roles & Permissions

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions
### CORS Issues
**Problem:** Frontend can't connect to backend
**Solution:**
```typescript
// In backend main.ts
app.enableCors({
  origin: 'http://localhost:5173', // or your frontend URL
  credentials: true
});
```
### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL service
sudo service postgresql status

# Verify database exists
psql -U username -d change_request_db
```
### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Kill process on port 3000 (backend)
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Kill process on port 5173 (frontend)
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9
```
### Authentication Issues

- Clear browser cookies and localStorage
- Check JWT secret consistency in backend .env
- Verify API_URL in frontend environment

### Module Not Found Errors
```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
## 📝 API Configuration
### Frontend API Setup
The frontend uses Axios with base configuration:
```typescript
// src/api/axios.ts
import axios from 'axios';

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000',
  withCredentials: true,
});

export default api;
```
